# RT Second Assignment
This repository contains the codes of the second assignment for Research Track I course.

# What I did
Apart from the codes already given, I made three python codes (client3.py, get_target_position_node.py, robot_status_node.py), msg files and srv files to run the python codes, and a launch file to launch action client and service nodes.

I added some comment out on some other codes I gave, but I don't change them.
